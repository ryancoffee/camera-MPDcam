/**
\mainpage Single Photon Counting Camera Software Development Kit (SPC3-SDK).
SPC3 is a 2D imaging chip based on a 64 x 32 array of smart pixels. Each pixel comprises a single-photon avalanche diode detector,
an analog front-end and a digital processing electronics. This on-chip integrated device provides single-photon sensitivity,
high electronic noise immunity, and fast readout speed. The imager can be operated at a maximum of about 100.000 frame per second with negligible
dead-time between frames. It features high photon-detection efficiency in the visible spectral region, and low dark-counting rates,
even at room temperature. The imager is easily integrated into different applications thanks to the input optical adapter and a high-speed
USB 3.0 computer interface.The camera differs from conventional CCD or CMOS sensors because it performs a fully digital
acquisition of the light signal. Each pixel effectively counts the number of photons which are detected by the sensor during the acquisition time.

\b IMPORTANT

Therefore, the parameter Exposure is not considered. Longer exposures are obtained by summing multiple frames (i.e. by setting NIntegFrames).
This operating mode does not degrade the signal to noise ratio. In fact, the camera does not have any read-out noise. 
In case of Advanced mode, all the parameters are controlled by the user which can set very long exposure times.
The time unit of the Exposure parameter is clock cycles i.e. the exposure time is an integer number of internal clock cycles of 10 ns periode. 
For example, the value of 10 means 100 ns exposure.

/**Set the acquisition parameters for the camera when a subarray is used.
This function has to be used in alternative to the function SPC3_Set_Camera_Par() when the acquisition of a subarray is needed. Subarray acquisition has few limitations:
- the pixels will be readout starting from the upper-left one and moving by lines of 32 pixels toward the center of the array
- in live mode it is possible to acquire only 1, 2, 4, 8 full lines. If Live mode is started when the camera is set for a different number of pixels, an INVALID_OP error will be returned.
- in snap and continuous mode any number of pixels ranging from 1 to 256 in the upper semiarray can be acquired (in any case starting from the corner and then reading by lines,
i.e. if 67 pixel are required 2 lines of 32 pixels + 3 pixels from the third line will be acquired), PROVIDED that the total data acquired is an integer multiple of 1024 bytes.
For the example above and assuming you camera is set to 8bit/pixel, this means that 1024 frames (or multiples) must be acquired.
Each frame will be Npixel*10ns + 160ns long. Acquisitions with a smaller number of frames are not possible. If an acquisition is triggered with invalid values of the parameter, an INVALID_OP error will be returned.

/**Save the selected images on the hard disk.
This function saves the acquired images on the hard disk. The output file format can be either a multipage TIFF with embedded acquisition metadata according to the OME-TIFF format or the proprietary SPC3 format. For FLIM measurements, use the SPC3_Save_FLIM_Disk() function.
If TIFF format is selected, the desired images will be saved in a file for each enabled counter. If SPC3 format is selected a single SPC3 file will be created for all the counters.
OME-TIFF file could be opened with any image reader compatible with TIFF file, since metadata are saved into the Image Description tag in XML format.
In order to decode OME-TIFF metadata, it is possible to use free OME-TIFF reader, such as OMERO or the Bio-Formats plugin for ImageJ. For more details see the OME-TIFF web site:
http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/. If subarray acquisition is enabled and the number of pixels is not an integer multiple of 32, the TIFF files will have has much rows of 32 pixels needed to accomodate all pixels, and the missing pixels will be put to 0, e.g.  if 67 pixels are acquired, the TIFF image will be 32x3, with the last 29 pixels of the 3rd row set to 0.
SPC3 file are binary files composed by a header with acquisition metadata followed by raw image data, containg the 8/16 bit pixel values in row-major order. The byte order is little-endian for the 16 bit images.
In case more counters are used, data are interlaced, i.e. the sequence of frames is the following:

/**Save the FLIM acquisition on the hard disk.
This function saves the acquired FLIM images on the hard disk. The output file format can be either a multipage TIFF with embedded acquisition metadata according to the OME-TIFF format or the proprietary SPC3 format. For standard measurements, use the SPC3_Save_Img__Disk() function.
For both formats, image data is composed by a set of images following a "FLIM first, time second scheme", i.e. with the following frame sequence:
1st gate shift of 1st FLIM measurement, 2nd gate shift of 1st FLIM measurement,...,nth gate shift of 1st FLIM measurement,1st gate shift of 2nd FLIM measurement, 2nd gate shift of 2nd FLIM measurement,...,nth gate shift of 2nd FLIM measurement,etc.
OME-TIFF file could be opened with any image reader compatible with TIFF file, since metadata are saved into the Image Description tag in XML format.
In order to decode OME-TIFF metadata, it is possible to use free OME-TIFF reader, such as OMERO or the Bio-Formats plugin for ImageJ. For more details see the OME-TIFF web site:
http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/. OME-TIFF metadata include the ModuloAlongT tag, which allows the processing of FLIM data with dedicated FLIM software such as FLIMfit (see http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/partner/flimfit).
SPC3 file are binary files composed by a header with acquisition metadata followed by raw image data, containg the 8/16 bit pixel values in row-major order. The byte order is little-endian for the 16 bit images. 
The header is composed by a signature of 8 byte (0x4d5044ff03000001, starting with 4d on byte 0), and a metadata section of 1024 byte, as follows (multibyte fields are little-endian):
